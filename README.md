## Description:

The Titanic's sinking is a well-known historical event.

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely regarded "unsinkable" RMS Titanic crashed after striking with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there were insufficient lifeboats for everyone on board, resulting in the deaths of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

While survival required some luck, it appears that some groups of people fared better than others.

In this task, you will create a prediction model that answers the question, "What types of people were more likely to survive?" Using passenger information (e.g., name, age, gender, socioeconomic status).

## Objective:
- Understand the Dataset & cleanup.
- Build a strong classification model to predict whether the passenger survives or not.
- Also fine-tune the hyperparameters & compare the evaluation metrics of various classification algorithms.
